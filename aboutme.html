     elementary education graduate from Ball State
      University. I’ve been working at a camp for
       elementary children this summer, and I’m 
       excited to find my first teaching position
        for the coming school year. I have several 
        original lesson plans I created during my 
        teaching internship that I look forward to
         implementing in my own classroom. I attended Brookwood Elementary myself and believe I would be a great fit for your second grade opening. It would be a joy for me
     to teach students in the same place that 
     sparked my love of learning.”</i></h6>
